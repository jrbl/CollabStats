# have separate scripts per report, rather than command-line options. So you 
  have one script to process the log files into a cache, then one script per 
  report. Won't be possible for wikistats until cached stats are implemented, 
  but we can do it right away for ircstats.

# For Change measurement in Wikistats: break this out into Average Inserted and 
  Average Deleted. Or maybe in addition. 

# Cache wiki stats in a persistent way so that reports can be generated without
  having to re-process the dump files.

# Tease apart registered users and wiki editors; call the latter Editors.  
  Gather the former from logging.xml iff it's available and display it as 
  "Registered Users".  If it's not available, indicate this is the case with 
  a sentinel.  Document the sentinel in the FAQ.

# Proposals: Before August 12, 2009 only count Proposals/; after this date,
  only count Proposal: .  This should be more general that that.  There 
  should be a "Namespace Collapse" feature, where you provide a YAML file 
  with dates, and it does the math.

# Rather than having Proposal Reg Editors vs. Editors, have Registered versus
  Anonymous Editor counts.

# Fix Edits/Page Today.  Numbers should all be greater than 1.

# For page stats, remove proposals/ filter; write add-on script that uses pag
  page stats and does Proposal filtering after the fact.
 
# For page stats, join talk pages to their content pages - make talk pages a 
  column on the output line for a content page

# CRC IRC chat files so we can recognize file content we've previously 
  processed and skip over it.

# Write an XChat parser/processor front-end

# Probably we want to get rid of irc_users.pickle in favor of a single big 
  entity stats keeper that keeps stats across domains - irc, wikis, whatever.
  What are the central abstractions for a user and the numbers about them,
  when the numbers about them can come from so many places?  And how does 
  this related to non-user entities, like pages or whole-wikis?

# Since user-merges requires that we specify the wiki domain with -w, perhaps
  we should explicitly require the irc domain be specified with -i, for 
  symmetry?

# SAXify
